-- Algebraic data types intro

-- We could also opt not to export any value constructors for Shape by just writing Shape in the export statement.
-- That way, someone importing our module could only make shapes by using the auxilliary functions baseCircle and baseRect.
-- Data.Map uses that approach. You can't create a map by doing Map.Map [(1,2),(3,4)] because it doesn't export that value constructor.
-- However, you can make a mapping by using one of the auxilliary functions like Map.fromList.
-- Remember, value constructors are just functions that take the fields as parameters and return a value of some type (like Shape) as a result.
-- So when we choose not to export them, we just prevent the person importing our module from using those functions,
-- but if some other functions that are exported return a type, we can use them to make values of our custom data types.

-- Not exporting the value constructors of a data types makes them more abstract in such a way that we hide their implementation.
-- Also, whoever uses our module can't pattern match against the value constructors.

-- Type parameters

-- e.g. data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
-- The a here is the type parameter. And because there's a type parameter involved,
-- we call Maybe a type constructor. Depending on what we want this data type to hold when it's not Nothing,
-- this type constructor can end up producing a type of Maybe Int, Maybe Car, Maybe String, etc.
-- No value can have a type of just Maybe, because that's not a type per se, it's a type constructor.
-- In order for this to be a real type that a value can be part of, it has to have all its type parameters filled up.

-- However, it's a very strong convention in Haskell to never add typeclass constraints in data declarations.
-- Why? Well, because we don't benefit a lot, but we end up writing more class constraints,
-- even when we don't need them

-- Derived instances

-- When we derive the Eq instance for a type and then try to compare two values of that type with == or /=,
-- Haskell will see if the value constructors match (there's only one value constructor here though) and

-- There's only one catch though, the types of all the fields also have to be part of the Eq typeclass.
